# cec-theatre
This is a code written in Python using Selenium and Chrome WebDriver.
The script uses Web Scraping to get the details of shows available on website "cec-theatres.com"
The script automates the website using chrome web-driver and returns you the available seats of each show in every theatre of US.
The script returns xslx files containing all show details of each movie for a given date.

The script is in two parts -
i) first_script
ii) final_script

Run the first_script first. It would return csv file named "result.csv" .
You need to add path of webdriver and result.csv file in your final_cec.py file.
